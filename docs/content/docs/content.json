This directory should then be populated with a .json file for every entry of the dynamic page. The filename will be the slug of the built page (without .json). \n\nThe homepage (/) can be created with a file in the root of the content directory named index.json. A corresponding template file with the name index.html is also needed. \n\n<em>Note: Support for nested routing is currently not implemented, but is a planned feature.</em> \n\nThe .json files should be populated with the dynamic properties in the template files."
