They can therefore be accessed through template files with the out dir as the root. \nExample: <code>&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/main.css\" /&gt;</code> will find the CSS file <code>&lt;out_dir&gt;/css/main.css</code>. \n\n<em>Note: Avoid relative routing when accessing static files, as it will not be the same path when built.</em>"
