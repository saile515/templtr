<code>/components</code> is where all component files are stored. The name of the component file will be the component name (without <code>.html</code>).

Components can include dynamic properties, which will be filled on a per-page basis in build-time.

<span class='note'>Note: Support for sorting components in directories is currently not supported, but is a planned feature.</span>
