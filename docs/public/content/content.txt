Single pages should be a <code>.json</code> file in the root of the <code>/content</code> directory with the same name as the template file (with a <code>.json</code> extension instead of <code>.html</code>).

Dynamic pages should be a directory in the root of the <code>/content</code> directory with the same name as the template file (without the <code>.html</code> extension). This directory should then be populated with a <code>.json</code> file for every entry of the dynamic page. The filename will be the slug of the built page (without <code>.json</code>).

The homepage (<code>/</code>) can be created with a file in the root of the content directory named <code>index.json</code>. A corresponding template file with the name <code>index.html</code> is also needed.

<span class='note'>Note: Support for nested routing is currently not implemented, but is a planned feature.</span>

The <code>.json</code> files should be populated with the dynamic properties in the template files. Property values can be strings, arrays, object, numbers, etc. String properties can also include html code.

To embed a file, surround the filename (relative to the public directory) with colons.
Example: <code>"content": ":/my-txt-file.txt:"</code>
<span class='note'>Note: All UTF-8 file formats are supported. It doesn't have to be a <code>.txt</code> file.</span>
